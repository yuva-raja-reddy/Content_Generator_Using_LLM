It’s about a broken system where 60% of applicants never hear back. \n Your mental health is not worth sacrificing for a system that doesn’t acknowledge your worth. \n Please remember, taking care of yourself is the real priority. \n Your dream job will come, but for now, breathe. 🌻",

The sleepless nights, the endless preparation, all for nothing.\n\nBut looking back, I realize it wasn’t nothing. It was the Universe’s way of saying, “Not this one, something better is on the way.”\n\nEvery single time, I’ve been shown why that rejection happened.\n\nDoors I thought I wanted to walk through were shut, only to have the right ones swing open.\n\nThe kind that aligned with my growth, my values, and my happiness.\n\nAt first, it stung. It hurt deeply. But now, when things don’t go as planned, I don’t panic.\n\nI don’t question my worth. I sit back, breathe, and trust. The Universe knows.\n\nI know there's another plan waiting. Something bigger, better, and just for me.\n\nTo anyone feeling the weight of rejection: trust that the closed doors are protecting you from something you can’t see right now.\n\nYour path is being cleared for something even more beautiful.",

It’s easy to get caught up in the 'big company = big talent' mindset, but that's not always the case.\n\nI’ve had the privilege of working with people from smaller companies (lesser known) who blow me away with their skills and dedication. They don’t need a fancy title or a famous brand behind them to prove their worth.\n\nI've seen the other side too—people in top-tier companies feeling lost, overwhelmed, or stuck, even though the world sees them as 'successful'.\n\nLet’s stop attaching someone’s value to the company they work for. Freshers especially need to hear this—skills are what matter, not the size of the company behind them.\n\nAt the end of the day, happiness and growth don’t come from a brand name, they come from doing what you love and constantly improving your craft.",
